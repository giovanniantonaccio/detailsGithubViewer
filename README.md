This is a React Native application developed during [Rocketseat Bootcamp](https://rocketseat.com.br/bootcamp) in order to allow users to add github users and see their favorite github repositories using github API. Data is saved in cellphone local storage and users are allowed to add or remove as many github users as they want. The favorite repositories of each user can be viewed in a webview.
